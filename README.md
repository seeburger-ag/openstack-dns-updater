# openstack-dns-updater

OpenStack DNS Updater listens on the RabbitMQ message bus. Whenever an
instance is created or deleted DNS updater creates or removes
its DNS A record. The name of the instance is directly used as its FQDN.
Hence instances in OpenStack should be named with their FQDN.
The IP address stored in DNS is the IP address of the first network interface
on the private network. You can easily change the script to store floating
IP address in DNS instead.

OpenStack DNS Updater works well on CentOS 7. You can copy it into your
`/usr/local/bin` directory and run it as user "nova". See the accompanying
systemd script. OpenStack DNS Updater logs into `/var/log/nova/dns-updater.log`
by default.

For using Ubuntu (upstart) you can copy
`openstack-dns-updater.upstart` to `/etc/init/openstack-dns-updater.conf` and
run `service openstack-dns-updater start`.

## SEEBURGER Fork

This fork is extended with the option to track floating IPs and assign
a machine to an internal and external name (both relative to a single domain).
